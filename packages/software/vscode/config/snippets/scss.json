	// Place your snippets for Sass here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"display flex": {
		"prefix": "flex",
		"body": [
			"display: flex;",
			"flex-direction: ${1:row};",
			"justify-content: ${2:flex-start};",
			"align-items: ${3:flex-start};"
		],
		"description": "Add flex properties"
	}
}
